                    Filling
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    1 or 2 eggs, beaten with a pinch of salt
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    breadcrumbs
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    250 g stretched-curd cheese, cut into cubes
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p class="title">Directions</p>
                <p>
                    Heat milk, butter and salt together in a large pot.
                    Once the mixture begins to bubble lower the heat and add all of the flour at one time. Mix vigorously with a wooden spoon to avoid lumps, until the dough comes away from the sides of the pan and forms a compact and elastic ball. It only takes a few minutes. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Turn off the fire, add the grated cheese and stir well to combine. Let it cool down. You can make this dough the day before, cover it with plastic wrap and store in the fridge.

                    <br>
                    To make the dough more malleable, knead it by hand just a little.
                    Divide the dough into small balls (about 18 g each). Press the dough down to make a hollow in the centre of each ball. Place a cheese cube into each dough hollow and fold the dough up to enclose the cube.

                <p>
                    Roll stuffed balls into flour, then egg, beaten with a pinch of salt, and then into the breadcrumbs.
                    Deep fry only a few pieces at a time to avoid lowering the oilâ€™s temperature.

                    <br>
                    To test frying oil temperature dip a toothpick into it, if you see bubbles start to form around the toothpick your oil is hot enough to fry. Fry until golden brown and crispy, drain on absorbent paper and serve immediately, very hot.
